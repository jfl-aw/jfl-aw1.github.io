Social Stabilization

- ....phase 1
I woke up in of my room, covered by the sheets and lying in bed. My head was heavy and filled with a dark emptiness that had deleted the reason to why I was still wearing the interface apparatus and what happened after logging in on the holodeck. I gazed at my ceiling trying to remember what happened,  a scenery of a clear blue sky filled with seagulls was being displayed and not long after came the product placement as it was common in every sponsored advertisement. Automatically kicked out of my stupor upon noticing the lack of the morning hello upon waking up, I glanced over at the clock. I was late. For some reason the alarm didn't go off and I didn't wake up making me now unable to reach my workplace in time. With barely any time to think I haphazardly got out of bed and prompted the wardrobe for my uniform, storming out to the kitchen as soon as I was done.
- Why didn't you wake me up Nazu?
The smell of french toast and coffee fluttered through the air, my intent was not in getting fed but was instead on finding my vitalt, so that I could go to work as fast as I could. Tracing back where I had been before losing myself on the other world, I managed to find the vitalt on the couch and stashed on my pocket as Nazu replied to me.
- The alarm was set like every other day.
- Then how come I only woke up now?
- Looking at the system log it seems you turned off the alarm yourself.
- What? - I'm a heavy sleeper but what Nazu said was simply preposterous - And you didn't find it weird that I never came out of the room?
- You had the "Do Not Disturb" setting on and your vitals were completely normal Quaid
Incapable of conquering the hunger I had to make a quick stop by the plate of food. The offering had been laid on a plate and with the usual fragrance, but a quick bite invaded me with a state of wrongfulness. Just as there is something wrong with the toasts, no doubt there was something wrong with the HomeAI. Nazu can't lie so its sensors obviously went haywire. I quickly spat out the jumbled mess that was in my mouth and rerouted myself to the path of my transport.
- When was the last time you had an update Nazu?
- Yesterday at 03:27:53 I received a routine update.
- Yesterday? Then start a full system check-up when I'm gone. If you find something you can't fix make an appointment with the tech crew to fix that when I'm back
- Will do Quaid, have a nice day.
A screen with breaking news popped out from the kitchen as I got out of my apartment. I reached out for my vitalt to catch up on what was happening when I heard a tumultuous cacophony coming from the end of the corridor. A man was trying to argue with the overarching lawbot cramping the corridor. A useless task like expecting the ambient screens to be working, today as well still showing the same error message as three days ago. My poor efforts at being discreet resulted in being called out by my floor neighbor.
- You! You know me! Tell them I didn't do anything wrong! Please-
A tall man with a police armor suit only slightly smaller than the lawbot by which he was shadowed, quickly shoved the other man to the inside of his home. Immediately glancing over to my position the officer informed me that the resident of the 2042 experienced a health issue and they came over to check up on him, nothing for me to worry about. A forced smile glued to his face and my own social responsibilities left me no choice but to nod in agreement. The path lying before me beckoned and I took it hurriedly.
 Reaching the comfort of my transport and after giving the destination, I finally got to check up on the news. It would seem the breaking news weren't that breaking nor were they news. "Something" had happened since yesterday's evening and both health and law enforcement officials took quick notice of it and are doing their best to do whatever it takes to help those in need.
- Please don't panic or worry and help our authorities and those around you by contacting any of the following departments, and us, if you find anything unusual.
So something like what just happened at my apartment fits the bill? The lack of information about what was actually happening was quickly overshadowed by the smart reminders to buy several selected brands. These compulsory sequences of information were transferred to the vitalt as I reached my destination. When the transport's digital screen was turned off I was greeted by the most unexpected view, most, if not all of my colleagues were standing outside seemingly having a very hush-hush conversation. Next to the currently unmanned improvised speech stand blocking the entrance of the office was someone convening directly with a smaller group of people. A familiar face stood out in the middle of the crowd and I reciprocally met her with a faraway hi as we met halfway.
- Did you hear the news?
- I saw what the news feed showed me. Although it wasn't very clear what the news were
- My goodness Quaid, do I have to do everything for you?! Let me fill you in
Mags would always pretend to do me a favor when actually she loves to gossip about whatever she got to overhear. It would seem that several employees didn't show up to work today and more than half of those may have been forcibly taken to a reeducation center. Notified by the law officials the company promptly disclosed that there were no public ties with any former employees and pledged to help out to guarantee public satisfaction. Mags explanation was cut short by the center piece of this grouping pointing out she wished to address the audience by now manning the stand. The transmission started, the building's displays now mirroring what we were seeing in person. 
- Are you alright Quaid? You don't look so well and your hand is shaking - Mags whispered to me while the HR professional continued her tirade 
- Yeah. Just having a weird day and didn't even have breakfast - A lie. I wasn't feeling very well but why was I shaking? I hid my hands on the trouser's pockets.  
Mags advised me to go home and rest as soon as possible. I thanked her, taking haven from the company's person bland report of the situation in this little side discussion of ours. There's nothing to worry, there's nothing happening, everyone gets the day off due to what happened with our ex-colleagues, cooperate with the authorities, have a nice day, remember we are on your side and we're all a big family. A big applause erupted from those around me, the contradictions of the statements were ignored and the smiles abound. Did I never notice these things before?
  I could feel myself change as time went by spending the rest of the day in bed trying to figure out how to understand what resting was. I heard some screams coming from the hallway, pleas of forgiveness and promises of doing whatever it takes as long as they weren't taken away. My curiosity fell flat like my appetite, perhaps as a result of my body aching all over. Without wishing on partaking any virtual sensations my eyes shuttered and for a while there was nothing besides the newfound oblivion of my existence. Artificial light greeted my sight, how long had it been since I fell asleep? The smell of dinner created a point in time, the smell of pasta was appetizing. My stomach agreed I should intake of this nutrition, especially since I found it to be closer to me than I expected. With the help of a fork I transferred a large portion of this magnificently looking spaghetti to the inside of my mouth and just as fast spat it all out. The taste was so utterly terrible it was borderline indescribable.
- Nazu did you finish the check-up?
- Yes. There wasn't anything wrong.
- What about that update?
- I rolled back the update just in case Quaid. I'm currently using last month's update on a provisional basis. Is there something wrong?
- The food you cooked, it tastes awful.
- Your vital signs are completely normal for a healthy male however it is up to you if you wish for a medical check-up. Would you like that Quaid?
- No. I'm fine Nazu - Why not take the test? Maybe something is wrong with me. No. There's definitely something wrong but not that wrong. Not that kind of wrong. - I'm fine.
Did I repeat that for my caretaker's sake or for my sake? My words followed a line that slumped away from straightforward impromptu ever so slightly. I take my leave to follow the nature's call into the bathroom, no matter the background noise that encircled around me nothing drowns the waves of thoughts flooding through my mind. The what's and the why's of many new questions are left floating around without any answers to catch them. With the deed done I ventured over the sink to wash the hands and peer at the mirror. The human shaped thing that looked at me in the mirror felt alien even though his shape was still the same as the day before, an old me acquiescing to a new me? My body was feeling better, only a slightly aching that influenced me into taking a shower to freshen up. I was getting dressed when an unexpected infonote popped up on the bedroom's mirror, there was someone at the door.
- Who is it Nazu?
- It's an inspector Quaid. I have to open the door.
- What's an inspector doing here? I didn't do anything - The bell rang, a physical confirmation for any human presence residing in the abode - Screw that, don't open the door.
- I must open the door Quaid.
- No, you do what I tell you - my fists clenched involuntarily, my body feeling lighter and ready to act.
- I'm afraid I can't do that Quaid - Nazu hadn't yet finished her sentence but the door had already been opened. I wanted to punch it, I wanted to kick it, and I wanted to kill it. I wanted to do all these things but most of all I wanted to be perceived like what the previous me was, especially in front of a lawbot. 
- Good evening Mr. Quaid I'm terribly sorry to disturb you at this dinner time - the inconspicuous middle aged man acquainted himself with the surroundings while having a small monologue to befriend me. He wore an old black leather coat, no visible armor in sight and the only ID in sight was the one on the screen confirming that he was part of the force - How are you today Mr Quaid?
- I'm fine inspector Len.
- Please, just Len. Old Len - he said very slowly. Was it a trait from the past or a trick for the future? Thinking too much about it would betray my character just as much as knowing the answer.
- Very well, Len. I've had a hectic day, starting with my company telling all the workers to take the day off because something happened to some of their employees
- I see... - the inspector took a mono ocular VR device from the inside of his coat and began fiddling with it - By now you should know what has been happening then?
- No I don't.
The inspector stopped what he was doing and looked straight at me, perhaps waiting for a lie to peek out from somewhere but I was telling nothing but the truth. Eventually he must have understood that and changed his tone
- Mr Quaid, as you can see I'm an old man and by now I'd love to go home a little earlier so I'll be completely straightforward and I hope you have no objections to that
- Not at all Len. Would you like some beverage or-
- No thank you Mr Quaid, I want to get to the point like I said and your shakes confirm your situation. - what the inspector said caught me completely off guard
Was I being targeted that morning after having encountered the other officer? Or maybe Mags talked to someone and told them she saw me shaking? My contemplation was averted by the mild mannered inspector.
- I need you to pay attention now Mr Quaid and answer my questions. When was the last time you ate or drank?
- Last time? I... I believe it was this morning - his focus divided between me and his mysterious fiddling left me wanting for answers - What does it have to do with anything? Why are you here Len?
- If that's how it's going to be I'm fine with that - a faint smile raised his cheeks - Your homeAI health report triggered a flag and we're here. We've noticed your intake of allowed products wasn't up to standards even though you're perfectly fine. A moment please - he paused briefly, focusing completely on the digital task he was carrying - Thank you. I know you don't sleepwalk Mr Quaid or it would be registered on your vitalt but I can tell you that's what happened yesterday after you used your holodeck. And yes Mr Quaid, I also know you don't remember anything.
-How-
- I checked your personal home recordings, its procedure Mr Quaid, don't take it personally
- What about my rights?! - I wanted to shout, to scream at this impudent man but I had to refrain myself from doing it - I understand if I were a criminal but I'm an honest man
- Everyone's honest before turning into a criminal. I'll retrace the steps you forgot and you're going to help me after. You logged in around nine pm and logged off at five to midnight, still wearing your suit you turned on your "Do not disturb" settings on the vitalt and moved into your room where you slept until your alarm went off. You turned off the alarm with a voice command and woke up some time later. After that we both know what happened
- If you know all that what do you need my help for?
- You see Mr Quaid, we know you logged in and we know you logged off. We know where you went when you logged in but we don't know what happened to you some time after and that's why I'm here. Surely you'll cooperate with us
- Yes, of course -the trap had been laid and there was no other option. Even so I wasn't entirely displeased with my action although my body objected wholeheartedly. A small portion of curiosity wanted to be quenched of the time lapse that existed in my present memories - What do you want me to do? 
The towering lawbot showed me to my couch and produced four long wires from the side of right arm after I sat down. Despite seemingly made of a composite metal they would move and bend as easily as any natural fiber. These tentacles inched over my head and positioned themselves one on each side of my head.
- Now Mr Quaid, you'll have to oblige me and put this stamp in your mouth - the investigator handed me an ant-sized grey object, too small to understand what it was made of - and relax while we wait for it to start showing its effects. It might be stressful for you so I hope you don't mind me locking all outside interference
- Very well - as the stamp touched my tongue a metallic taste expanded throughout my mouth and I smelled some iron like substance for mere seconds. And then a blast of cold followed by a natural warming up - Let me give you the password so you can do that
A genuine smile was drawn on the man's face. The innocence of my attitude made the old man rejoice, very much perhaps due to how oblivious I was to the true situation of current affairs. Like a father teaching his son that the real lesson has yet to come, he compassionately answered me.
- Thank you Mr Quaid but we have our methods, so you just relax
And so he sat by the kitchen, restarting what he was doing before as I sat on the contiguous living room. I felt an overwhelming relaxation despite the absence of sensory stimuli coming from the now turned off interactive screens and the central sound system that complemented it. My eyes began to close, a set of instructions were given by the fading distant law enforcer, separated by an ever growing blackness that somehow turned into light.
 Dazzling lights and sounds were all around me, a nearly abstract surrounding composed of all different geological and human ages. A group formed of too many different oneselfs marched over to the same gate, a sign hanging on top of it in neon-lights reminded the users what they were getting into. Not that the sign was needed given the music that was blasted by the ancient speakers of a bygone era could be heard everywhere, it was simply compulsory by what had been defined by the sponsors of this VR-venue. The configuring AIds ensured everyone getting in would be on par with the standards which meant the including of ID personalized drinks and fun hats, also personalized to whatever you were looking as at the time. Even headless people need to have fun. It's my turn to configure to the party now. I tick the box agreeing to whatever the seemingly infinite user agreement contract states and I'm informed by the AId that I'll be allotted a total of five drinks when the bar opens. The AId reminds me that talking about certain topics or getting reported by other users will hinder my sensory experience and that my social record is undeletable. A meaningless formulaic matter for the me of before, like the intake of water through the oral orifice when feeling thirst. With the configurations done, the option to receive and send invitations was unlocked, now a wall of animated invitations clouded the only one that I was looking for. My experience was muted while I heard the jingle play and confirmed to which product it belonged to so that I could be moved to the room appointed on the desired invitation, a small area on the left of the central rave hub. Light grey smoke covered the area, an attempt to improve the experience of how party venues back in the day. Old leather couches were the appointed furniture, popping out of the ground whenever someone wished to sit. I'm sure they'd smell of cigarettes, an addicting pastime banned long ago, were I rich enough to have access to smell in one of the new and prohibitive versions of holodecks. A cardboard bipedal automaton waved at me and I waved back, I turned my public idle stance to on so that I could whisper with my friend. My memories were fast-forward through the personal chitchat and the rest of my social venture. And then everything stopped. Rewind. It was the end of the party. Patrons in every area had started to disconnect from the experience, expected as it was a weekday and many had to work in the following day. And so, like in any other party the public grounds moved every engage hub closer, making sure the venue never felt too empty or too full. My, almost, papier-mâché robotic partner was exhilarated with the party and couldn't stop reviving the moment we just shared, lauding the retro rave and everyone that made it possible. She was still fired up echoing the public feed when she suddenly logged off. I checked my friends list to make sure, she was indeed offline. Thinking how weird that was I decided to write her a message for when she got back online, I didn't think it was such a pressing matter that I would send the message directly to her vitalt. And then it happened, while I was still recording the audio. My surroundings started to change, a slow deconstruction took place, or was it reconstructing something else? Vague figures would seem to appear and immediately morph into something else, the sound that came out of my mouth became slurred while whatever could be heard not coming from me seemed to constantly fade out, change location and fade in an abnormal cycle. This redundancy wasn't like a cycle after all, more like a downward spiral as the perceived result was either a crash or me logging off. There was nothing else on these memories, no matter how much I tried to pry the feeling of there being something more. Rewind. I'm back at beginning of the distortion. Everything is frozen and the changes are seemingly different than before. I could feel now. I felt befuddled by the disappearance of my companion and concentrated on the message. My memories played along, now at a slower pace, the elongation of my dictation overly obvious but not my feelings when it came to the disposition of what enveloped me. The ever changing fragments nothing else contained but the figments of my imagination, nor had they ever contained or attracted my attention. Their melting seemed to ignore the flow of time, dilating in its own special way in a separate reality. By now the emotions that pushed me to send a message felt like an ever eternal and immutable constant of the experience, very different from the inconstant and inconsequent corruption of the setting. Nothing else was distinguishable when a new feeling was processed. Joy. Limbo welcomes me, there's a brief pause. I open my eyes.   
- Thank you Mr Quaid, what I got should be enough. I hope you can withstand that huge headache you just got because I'll need you to accompany me to the nearest reeducation center
Indeed, the pain was tremendous, circumnavigating my head without ever leaving the skull. I could barely word out my question, much less ask what he meant by enough.
- Why a reeducation center?
- You see Mr Quaid, like I said, you triggered the supply intake checker and-
- I wasn't hungry - I coughed out cutting his line of thought.
- For weeks? - The man let out a loud laugh - You're a funny guy Mr Quaid but a terrible liar. The values tell a very different story but you can tell that again to the Social Ecosystem Prosperity official entrusted to you after I drop you off at the center, I'm sure he'll love it. Can you walk?
I barely heard his question amid the pain and confusion that were present at the time. I turned to him, the lawbot partially blocking my sight. A weapon was on the table next to a glass of juice that he had probably ordered while I had my eyes closed. The man looked at me; a devious smile took over his face before I had even said anything.
- Can't. Won't - my charade was shattered
- I was afraid you'd say that. As I'm obliged by law, let me remind you that you were recorded saying that you won't accompany me and the system gave me the green light for my following action. Goodnight Mr Quaid. Sleep him
There was nothing I could do. It didn't matter if I wanted to call the police and complain how I did nothing wrong. Granted by the same system that transmitted the sentence he gave me, judge Len had full access and control over my home. The executioner lawbot next to me touched me arm and I didn't feel anything else.

Weeks had gone by at the reeducation center, what started as an almost empty looking, heavily partitioned, vast warehouse ended up becoming terribly overcrowded with others like me. Different teams studied our refusal to eat any of the awful tasting food and drink that was given to us, making us end up being on the drip every so often due to how weak we felt. We would experience things like depression, a disease that had been eradicated ages ago, was what the medbot that diagnosed told me. I no longer had purpose, I no longer belonged. My place in the mechanism of society had ceased to be. Only when I managed to stomach the food they gave us would I be able to feel better. Until then, according to another bot, we were deemed unfit for society. Maybe we caught a weird bug? I had always heard the supply centers were squeaky clean, but my room colleague did system maintenance over some and told me the companies only do the bare minimum, so who knows what plagues can develop there. One other guy told me how this is all part of a huge secret conspiracy and how we're just pawns in a war between two huge corporations that control the world. One of the corps managed to one-up the other by hacking into every house AI system and changing the food list, just so they could now promote to the masses how the competitor's products are bad and grind their profit to the ground. Anyway, recently, every other day we finally got to eat something that didn't taste like trash and we all felt somewhat better. Good enough to stop caring about being unique, the social path everyone strives for. Good enough to understand that being human allows me to be more than a machine, instead of being an efficient meatbot that gets farmed of its vitality for the sake of being an obligatory consumer. Good enough to get mad at the awful music that plays constantly over the never-ending soft-spoken mantra of social qualities, values and products that we must adhere to. Or is it cling to? I can't differentiate anymore. I can't even think like I did anymore either. Even my nights became different, sleeping like a rock and never having a dream or a nightmare, waking up feeling mentally drained every morning just as if I had been studying for hours instead of sleeping. Maybe it has something to do with the weird machines connected to our bed pods, supposedly all they're used to is to reeducate us while we sleep and monitor our vital signs, if you believe them that is. The lights are turned off informing the inmates that they must adhere to their bed curfew. I lay in bed and close my eyes, ignoring the inside screen and pretending the audio is the precursor of Morpheus' arrival. An out of place sound followed by a beautiful voice seem familiar, making me pay such fastidious attention that I abstain from comprehending if I'm asleep or awake.
- For tonight you're going to learn how to build your own portable spectrometer so you can test which supplies have been tampered with what behavior altering drugs, so you can avoid them and teach others to do the same.  As with previous contacts you will forget everything I'll tell you until the start of phase 2. Believe in the endeavor of your efforts tonight for a freer tomorrow. Liberum crux.
